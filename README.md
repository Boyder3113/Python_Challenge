<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains two seperate segements of Python code. Both code segements import a pre-populated CSV and preform the requested data analysis on the datasets contained in the CSVs.

PyBank_Main analyzes banking data returning the total revenue for the provided months as well as a count of the total months provided in the CSV. PyBank_Main also loops through the CSV to calculate the average change in revenue in dollars, it will also return the greatest positive and negative changes to revenue, giving both the dollar amount and the date the change occured.

PyPol_Main analyzes election data, looping through the data and returning a total vote count as well the winner of the election and a breakdown of how many votes each candidate received as both a number and a percent.

Both code segments will print out results in your terminal as well as create new CSVs with plain text print results.
